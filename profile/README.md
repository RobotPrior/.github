## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

For wide-scale uptake, RobotPrior will integrate all algorithms in the Core Model, which will be an open-source software package based on ROS2, to be released with yearly updates through an AI on Demand catalogue. For maximal development speed, inside as well as outside the consortium, we will accompany the core model with an open-source prototyping testbed (a small mobile manipulator), simulation environments of varying complexity/fidelity, tutorials, and documentation.
